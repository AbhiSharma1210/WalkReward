# Walk Reward
Welcome to Walk reward. 
The aim of this project is to reward user with an NFT based on the distance they walk for N number of days. A badge will be provided in the wallet address that they add

# Objectives (Internal)
1. Custom build NFT badge possibly utilizing a Genrative AI for image.
2. Dynamic NFT that updates itself instead of adding a new NFT and cluttering the wallet.
3. A simple HTML page that links with the smart contract to update the walk distance.
